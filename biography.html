              <p>My name is Mireille Abd El Sayed and I'm a second-year design student at Concordia University.

                So far in life, I have tested my own perspectives on what I deem as success and failure. I have learned that no matter the issues you may face, no one can stop you if you have a goal in mind. Going into university, "design" was not the major that I was looking for. I had always dreamed of getting into architecture. However, with this being my second year, I have realized that I do love what I'm doing and that everything does happen for the best, whether you believe in it or not. I may have to take a longer, more difficult path to get to where I want, but I know for sure that once I do attain that goal, I would have accomplished far more than someone who got there without making as much effort. Until that day can come, I promise myself to never give up because I have already come a long way and I will do everything I can to reach that dream of mine. I am still at the beginning of the road and am eager to learn more. All I know is that I have always been moved by art and I want to be able to give others the same feeling through design, which is what I will hopefully achieve in the future.</p>

              <p>Before getting into university, I had never touched any adobe softwares or anything design-related. I was just passionated by architecture and by the idea of how much I would be able to make an impact in the world as a future designer. However, in the span of a year, I can say that I am really efficient in all adobe softwares, in rhino, autocad, fusion 360, and now atom. Before this DART 349 class, I had also never touched any programming apps and I knew nothing about the subject, but little by little, I see myself liking it more and more. Since I began the "design" program, I was sure that I would want to work as an industrial designer for either a company such as Bombardier or any car company. However, the more we learn in this class, the more I find myself interested in the software languages and wanting to learn more about UX design.</p>
